# Summary
### The most difficult problem that the world anticipated was the Big Data problem. Because of the big data problem, data is rising at a far quicker rate than processing rates. And because storage costs are decreasing on a daily basis, consumers, as well as practically all corporate and scientific institutions, are storing an increasing amount of data. Social activities, scientific studies, biological discoveries, and sensor gadgets all contribute significantly to big data. Big data is useful to society and industry, but it also poses problems to scientific communities. Traditional tools, machine learning algorithms, and methodologies are incapable of processing, organizing, and analysing large amounts of data. Although open-source systems like as Hadoop and Apache Spark are widely used for scalable machine learning methods, methodologies, and tools.
## Issues noticed:
1. Management Issue
2. Storage Issue
3. Processing Issue

# Outline:
### Business intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process that analyses data and presents actionable information to assist scientists, corporate executives, business managers, and other end users in making better educated business choices. BI encompasses a variety of tools, applications, and methods that assist businesses in gathering data from internal and external sources, preparing it for analysis, creating and executing queries to gain valuable information from the data, and generating reports and charts for data visualizations so that the analytical results generated will assist organizations in making accurate and timely decisions.
