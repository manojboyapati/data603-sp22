# Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems
### When people think of databases, they picture tables with rows and columns. Databases are logically modelled sets of information, while database management systems allow you to control access to a database. 
### All database management systems use the relational data model, and relational database management systems use SQL to access and manage data. 
### Despite the different data models, NoSQL databases are designed to maximize availability at the expense of consistency.
## Key Value
### Key value databases are very similar to relational databases in that they store data as a single collection. Common use cases for key value databases are caching, message queuing, and session management.
## Graph Database
### The graph database is a subcategory of the document store model, and adds an extra layer by highlighting the relationships. In graphics databases, a node is a representation of a single entity tracked by a graphical database.



# Data Lake
### A data lake is a location where a large amount of data is stored in its native format. It uses a flat architecture and object storage to store the data. These store all your organization's data in a single central location. The data lake is an open format and durable. 
### Enterprise data lakes lack important functionality and are becoming a data swamp.
###  Data lakes are difficult to protect and manage. As a result, enterprises tend to work in complex architectures.
## Uses of Data Lake
- Use the data lake as a landing zone for all of your data
- Mask data containing personal information before entering the data lake.
- Secure your data lake with role and view based access controls.
